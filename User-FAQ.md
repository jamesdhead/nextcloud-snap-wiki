**Q: I can't connect to my Nextcloud Box any more. What can I do?**

A: Connect a monitor/TV/projector to the HDMI port and see what the Box is telling you.
As an alternative, try connecting the hard drive to another USB port to see if that helps.

**Q: How to switch Nextcloud Box on/off?**

There is no button :) Is there a way to switch Nextcloud on/off in a friendly way?

**Q: Is there a "sleep mode"?**

The hard disk is constantly flashing and there is a bit of sound. Is it planned/possible to have a kind of sleep/wakeup mode?
