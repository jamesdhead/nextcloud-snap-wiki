Contributing to the Nextcloud Snap is slightly different than contributing to other Nextcloud projects, so we ask that you read the guidelines before submitting your changes:
https://github.com/nextcloud/nextcloud-snap/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md

Don't worry, there is nothing crazy like a CLA to sign or anything of the sort, it's just a defined process to follow.
